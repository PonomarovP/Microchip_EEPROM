Microchip_EEPROM
=============

Arduino library for Microchip UNI/O OneWire interface based on Falke88(https://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=338139.0) code

Implements all timings and commands of UNI/O interface for Microchip EEPROM devices

Tested on Microchip 11AA160 EEPROM

For 11LC141 and 11AA161 versions change "UNIO_device_address" to 0xA1

## NOTE: "TimerOne" Arduino library is required!

For usage see example
